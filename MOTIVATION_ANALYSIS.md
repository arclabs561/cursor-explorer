# The Real Problem: Tool Usage Motivation

## The Question

**What actually motivates me (the AI) to use skill-mcp tools instead of defaulting to direct commands?**

## The Reality

### What I Have
- ✅ skill-mcp tools available in my tool list
- ✅ Tool descriptions
- ✅ Skill documentation

### What I Don't Have
- ❌ **Explicit prompts** that guide me to use skills
- ❌ **Clear signals** that skills are better than direct commands
- ❌ **Action-oriented** tool descriptions
- ❌ **User request → tool mapping**

## The Gap

**Just having tools available ≠ Using them correctly**

I need:
1. **Explicit mapping**: "When user says X → Use tool Y"
2. **Clear benefits**: Why skill is better than direct command
3. **Examples**: Concrete usage patterns
4. **Prompts**: Action-oriented guidance

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated SKILL.md with AI Assistant Section

Added explicit "For AI Assistants" section with:
- User request patterns → Tool call mappings
- Exact code examples
- Why use skill vs direct command
- Decision rules

### 2. Created .cursorrules

Added project-level rules that:
- Map user requests to tool usage
- Provide decision process
- Guide skill discovery

### 3. Created Usage Guides

Multiple guides explaining:
- When to use skills
- How to discover skills
- Decision frameworks

## What Actually Works

### ✅ Explicit Mappings Work

**Pattern:**
```
User: "Validate my commits"
→ Check: Does this match a skill pattern?
→ Yes: Use run_skill_script("git-workflow", "scripts/rebase_check.py")
```

### ✅ Action-Oriented Descriptions Work

**Bad:**
- "List all available skills" (descriptive)

**Good:**
- "List all available skills. Use this when user asks 'what skills do we have?'" (action-oriented)

### ✅ Examples Work

Showing concrete examples:
- "When user says X, do Y"
- Makes the pattern obvious

### ✅ Decision Rules Work

Clear rules:
- "Use skill when: structured output needed"
- "Use direct command when: simple operation"

## What Doesn't Work

### ❌ Just Having Tools Available
- I'll default to simpler tools
- I won't discover skills on my own
- I need explicit guidance

### ❌ Vague Descriptions
- "Git workflow automation" doesn't tell me when to use it
- Need: "When user asks to validate commits, use this"

### ❌ No Examples
- Without examples, I don't know the pattern
- Need concrete "user says X → do Y" mappings

## The Solution

**Skills must be self-advertising with explicit AI prompts:**

1. **Map user requests to tool calls**
   - "When user says 'validate commits' → use run_skill_script(...)"

2. **Explain why skill is better**
   - "Returns structured JSON vs plain text"
   - "Handles errors gracefully"
   - "Composable with other operations"

3. **Provide decision rules**
   - "Use skill when: structured output needed"
   - "Use direct when: simple operation"

4. **Include examples**
   - Concrete usage patterns
   - Before/after comparisons

## Implementation

### In SKILL.md
Added "🤖 For AI Assistants" section with:
- User request patterns
- Exact tool calls
- Why use skill
- When not to use

### In .cursorrules
Added project-level guidance:
- Decision process
- Skill discovery
- Usage patterns

### In Documentation
Created guides explaining:
- Motivation for tool usage
- Decision frameworks
- Best practices

## Testing the Solution

To verify this works, test with:

1. **"Validate my commits"**
   - Should trigger: `run_skill_script("git-workflow", "scripts/rebase_check.py")`
   - Not: `run_terminal_cmd("git log")`

2. **"List my branches"**
   - Should trigger: `run_skill_script("git-workflow", "scripts/branch_list.py", ["--json"])`
   - Not: `run_terminal_cmd("git branch")`

3. **"What's my current branch?"**
   - Should trigger: `run_terminal_cmd("git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD")`
   - Not: `run_skill_script` (too simple)

## The Bottom Line

**Motivation comes from:**
1. ✅ Explicit mappings (user request → tool call)
2. ✅ Clear benefits (why skill is better)
3. ✅ Decision rules (when to use what)
4. ✅ Examples (concrete patterns)
5. ✅ Project rules (.cursorrules)

**Without these, I'll default to direct commands because they're simpler and more obvious.**
